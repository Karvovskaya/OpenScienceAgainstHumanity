The goal of the game is to pair the white cards (prompts) and the black cards in the funniest, most provocative, or smartest way you can.

Shuffle the deck of white cards and deal four to each player. You can only look at your own hand of cards. Leave the rest of the white cards and black cards separated into face-down stacks. Determine a Reviewer: the person that thought about publishing last will go first.

The Reviewer reveals the first black card. Read the card aloud and leave it face up on the table. Have each other player choose a white response card from their hand that fits best to the revealed black card and place it face down on the table. After every player has played a card, the Reviewer shuffles and then reveals all played white cards and reads out loud how they complete the prompt on the black card. The Reviewer picks the smartest, funniest and/or the card they like the most. You can also discuss all options as a group and collect votes to determine a winning card. The player with the winning card will receive 3 citation points to their h-index.
Discard all played white cards in a discard pile and discard the black card back to the box. Draw a new white card until every player has 4 white cards on their hands.

Bonus points: After each round, when all the white cards have been revealed, each player is allowed to tell a funny, horrendous or otherwise entertaining story or fact from their own experience that matches one of the black and white card combinations on the table. Depending on how much laughter, pity or knowledge gain is spread among the group, the Reviewer may award up to 5 additional citation points to the player.

Change the starting player in clockwise order and repeat the process until there are no more black cards outside the box. If you run out of white cards, shuffle the discard pile and draw from those. Whoever has the most citation points at the end of the game wins.
